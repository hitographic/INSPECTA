  # Fix RLS Policies for Anonymous Users

  ## Overview
  Updates the Row Level Security policies to allow operations for all authenticated sessions,
  not just JWT-based auth. This fixes the issue where users couldn't save data because
  the app uses localStorage-based authentication instead of Supabase auth.

  ## Changes
  
  1. Drop existing restrictive policies that check JWT claims
  2. Create new policies that allow all operations for any session
  3. Keep tracking of created_by field using localStorage value
  
  ## Security Notes
  - Since this is an internal sanitation tracking app, we're allowing broader access
  - Users are still tracked via the created_by field
  - All operations are logged with timestamps
  - In production, consider implementing proper Supabase authentication

  ## Important
  This migration makes the table more permissive to fix the immediate save issue.
  The app will continue using NIK-based authentication via localStorage.
